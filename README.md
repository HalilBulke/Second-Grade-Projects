# Second-Grade-Projects

## General info
These are my second year lab assignments as a computer engineering student. First term we learned Data Structures course using C++. 
Second term we learned Algorithms course using Java.
	
## Technologies
* First term we learned fundamentals of data structures, relationships between data representation, algorithm design, and program efficiency. 
Lists, stacks, queues, trees, priority queues, hashing, graphs. Multi-dimensional/triangular/band/sparse matrix representations. 
Single/double (circular) linked lists. Prefix/infix/postfix expressions. 

* Second term we learned basic concepts of algorithms. Asymptotic notation, performance measurement, space/time complexity. 
Recursive algorithms, recursive relations, introduction to the concept of algorithm analysis. 
Binary search tree, recursive and iterative binary tree traversals. 
Graphs, depth/breadth first search, spanning trees, shortest path problem, activity on vertex/edge networks. 
Selection, insertion, bubble, counting, quick, merge, heap, radix sorting algorithms and their analysis.
	
## Setup 
You will see detailed explanation of assignment instructions and how to execute codes in given assignment Pdfs. 
Also you can run codes with the given input output examples.
